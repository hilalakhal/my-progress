Okay so this is the start
Maybe it sounds so lame or too late for me since I'm already in my 6th semester of my collage
But it's okay, I just want to keep progressing

So I will start from learning about github
*I already learned about web programming, python, and C++ even still in beginner level

So here I want to check or test :
1. I already have github account since last year so this is not my first time
2. I want to try commit changes at github
3. I want to know more about repository things at github
